<br>SWAPI is an API filled with bountiful Star Wars data. 
It holds information about the people, planets, starships 
<br>and more within main Star Wars films. I chose SWAPIbecause I am a huge Star Wars fan, and like many other 
<br>fans I want to know more about the characters I grew up watching in the films. Where did 
they come from? 
<br>What was the name of their ship? What films did they appear in? All of our questions can be answered by 
<br>SWAPI together with a bit of JavaScript!
        
<br><h3><a href= "https://swapi.co/about">swapi.co</a></h3>
        
Gives a brief explanation of a simple call and the base URL, but we will go deeper.Aside from retrieving basic 
<br>information from the API, we will implement a search function to extract data. Based on user input, our 
<br>final product will be code that displays the name of a searched character,along with the films they appeared in, 
<br>their home world, and the name of their starships.
